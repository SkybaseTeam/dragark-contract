# A novel on-chain gaming experience 
Dragark is a fully on-chain game. This game represents a new frontier made feasible solely by blockchain technology. Every aspect of the game, including its entire functionality, is executed on the blockchain through Smart Contracts.

- On-chain games have a lot of unique characteristics that distinguish them from traditional, centralized games:

- Transparent and Auditable: Everyone can see and check every item, action, and achievement in the game.

- Perpetual Operation: On-chain games, known as "forever games," persist as long as the underlying blockchain exists.

- Customizable: Players can add their ideas or even create new clients based on Dragark's core gameplay.

- Enhanced Security and Transparency: Being on the blockchain means Dragark benefits from the same level of security as cryptocurrencies, ensuring safety and transparency for players.
